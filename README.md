## Overview
Energy Bricks is a simple framework for analyzing wholesale energy market risk exposure. The tool utilizes day-ahead Locational Marginal Price forecasting to identify hours with high price and market exposure. To-date the tool is built for NEISO, and utilizes several different regression and ML models for forecasting.

Features include:

* Day-Ahead Locational Marginal Pricing, used to inform hourly risk and cost management strategies.
* Visualization of wholesale prices against forecasts, utilizing model validation data.
* Trained regression and machine learning pipelines for nodal price forecasting in NEISO.

## Data Pipeline




to address underlying uncertainties in the input data such limited coverage, instruments or observing systems biases, and the limitations of the model itself. GEFS quantifies these uncertainties by generating multiple forecasts, which in turn produce a range of potential outcomes based on differences or perturbations applied to the data after it has been incorporated into the model. Each forecast compensates for a different set of uncertainties.


Getting the data in the right and efficient way. It’s more about mechanical, being able to deal with data, and getting what you need.
